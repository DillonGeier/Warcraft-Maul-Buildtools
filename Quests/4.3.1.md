Updates:
 - Fix a desync related to Timed Action towers
 - New command -buildings <colour> (Get list of a players hybrid towers) so you can beg even more
 - Lives are now reduced base on HP % left on leaked mobs (max values: 5% normal, 10% champion)

Balancing:
 - New formula for calculating difficulty armour and hitpoints
 - Goblin Blademaster now attacks air like the tooltip states
 - clarified Ice Troll Joker description, as it does need a slow to work
